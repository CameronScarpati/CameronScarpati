# Hi there, I'm Cameron Scarpati! 👋

## About Me

I'm Cameron J. Scarpati, a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics double major at Vanderbilt University, proudly maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I'm really into the intersection of technology and finance, and I'm keen on exploring how these fields can merge to innovate and solve complex problems. While I've got some experience with tools like NestJS, Angular, and Kotlin, and a bit of AWS, I’m still on a learning journey, eager to deepen my understanding. I’m passionate about making an impact in the finance sector through tech, and I’m always looking for ways to blend my academic knowledge with real-world experience.
